    <h1>2nd SEPTEMBER 2023</h1>
    <h2>8am - 10am</h2>
    <p>Our Great Ocean Road day trip begins in Melbourne, the capital of Victoria.The first leg of our journey took us along the Surf Coast, known for its famous surf beaches and relaxed coastal towns. With the sun now fully above the horizon, we cruised along the Surf Coast. At 8:00 AM, we reached Jan Juc, where the salty breeze and the sound of crashing waves invigorated us. A little later, at 9:00 AM, we found ourselves at the world-famous Bells Beach lookout, capturing the breathtaking view.</p>

    <h2>2:30pm - 4:30pm</h2>
    <p>The most anticipated part of our journey awaited in the afternoon. At 2:30 PM, we stood before the Twelve Apostles, towering limestone stacks rising from the sea. We spent the next two hours exploring, capturing photos from Gibson Steps, Loch Ard Gorge, and the Razorback.

    <h2>5pm - 6pm</h2>
    <p>As the clock approached 5:00 PM, we continued our drive, discovering the Arch and London Arch. Each formation was a testament to the timeless forces of nature. The Arch, with its natural bridge, was particularly captivating. We couldn't help but think of the millennia it took to shape these wonders.</p>
